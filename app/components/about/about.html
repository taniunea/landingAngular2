                        It is envisaged that the Malmo would organize and present internationally significant exhibitions of artworks from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries while also specializing in Nordic art and architecture. Within the Gug Foundation’s international constellation of museums, including the Solomon R. Gug Museum in New York, the Peggy Gug Collection in Venice, the Museum Bilbao, and the future Gug Abu Dhabi, the Malmo would be distinctive in its active inclusion of design and architecture in its programming.

                        From a global perspective, Malmoi is emerging as a city to watch. Standing at the intersection of East and West, malmo has one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Europe. The city recently embarked on an ambitious yet highly sensitive program of renewal and development, initiating the greatest urban change in its history since Malmo became two hundred years ago. Within the Gug Foundation’s international constellation of museums, including the Solomon R. Gug Museum in New York, the Peggy Gug Collection in Venice, the Museum Bilbao, and the future Gug Abu Dhabi, the Malmo would be distinctive in its active inclusion of design and architecture in its programming.he proposed Malmo Museum will be an innovative, multidisciplinary museum of art and design. It should be of the highest architectural quality, creating a meaningful presence in Malmo and offering civic space where both residents and visitors can gather.
